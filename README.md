# Firstmilestoneproject_Marta

My user centric front end development project is my resume for myself and as it will also give credits to my university course program. It is also the official site for showing my projects to my professors and fellow students at one webpage. I wanted to create a webpage that has my "face" with a touch of who I am and what I want to present.


UX

Mobile-first design focuses on the most important components of an application, then addresses the more complex elements for larger screens.
Also it adresses the principle to reduce visual clutter or visual noise. By collapsing the navigation items behind a single icon,we can see that icons that are normally horizontal are displayed vertically to take up minimal real estate on the mobile view. Fluid layout: to help us design for the different screen sizes, we use a fluid layout.A fluid layout avoids fixed values in the CSS properties, which makes the elements' size relative to their viewport.
CSS media queries are the most common approach for coding a responsive website.
In order to implement responsive design on our web applications, a few fundamentals must be put in place.
And one of these is the viewport meta tag.


Features

The first page is something I built this webpage up and gave the inspiration. I believe that taurus represents a strong and determined character who I believe I am and also want to be. The colour palette is grey and yellow. Yellow is representing also something that is fun, because coding is a something new that I am learning. I also put the contact button with a modal to write a message to me, because I encourage people who are seeing this webpage to send me ideas for the projects.
The second page is taken from my resume. It is clear overview of my education and work history.
The third page is my toolbox overiew. It is the skills and web development technology I am learning in this course and will deploy to my projets. That leads straight to the project section with 3 future projecs I will be doing.
On the contact page there is a section for sending me a message. The footer has my contact information and links to my university and different social sites.

The modal attribution was taken straightly from bootstrap (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_modal&stacked=h). With adding the modal dialog I also add using of JavaScript.
In web development, a modal is an in page overlay that will be launched when the user clicks a sign-up or contact (in my case) button.
This prevents the user from having to visit a separate page and will hopefully increase the number of ,essages that I receive.
So to avoid us having to retype everything, I'm going to copy and paste the basic modal code from Bootstrap's documentation.

In the future I would like to update the projects section with my project links in the existing GitHub and Live webpage (desktop) icon links. So it will be useful for my professor and fellow students to see what I have done during this course. It is also a place to show my future empoyees my projects.
Also I would like to add the function of the collpsed navbar icon to be fixed and scroll along the pages.


Technologies used

Languages used: HTML, CSS and framework for CSS, Bootstrap.
In this project I used three different libaries: for Bootstrap.CSS, Bootstrap.js and jquery.js (links--> https://getbootstrap.com)

Testing

The landing page gives away very quickly that who is this person and that the bull draws attention to what could it be about. Also the navbar shows on the top left what conent is in this page.
In the mobile view the toggle icon looks elegant and open open also on the left side. The title is yellow so it srtands out infornt of the dark background.
The next pages show chronologically first my education and then work history. Here everuthing is about alternating coulurs and the contrast of yellow and gray lets the viewer easily follow.
The projects section is in the modal form and the bright blue buttons are very visible so it is clear where to find the projects. Also the background with lightbulbs symbolize that there will be many good ideas here.
The contact form is also simple and makes it easy for the potential client/partner to write about ideas they would have for my projects. The contact form is easy to fill and it has protection against loosing the message as the form lines are required to be filled otherwise it cannot be sent out.
All the links will open up with the new tab using the 'target="_blank".
The CV icon on the footer bar enables to dowlnoad my CV. The CV direction is also in my menu bar. All the links and dowload buttons work except the project github and live webopage links as they are not done yet.
Additionally I have the link to my university at the footer so people can see where I continue studying after the Code Institute course.
The site is responsive and has great user experinece in mobiles, tablets and desktops. It emplys the mobile first approach.

Deployment

For validating CSS and HTML rules, I went through the https://validator.w3.org/ and it found 37 errors.

The hosting platform for this site is GitHub.
Here is the link for my site https://martakortslaur.github.io/Firstmilestoneproject_Marta/.
You can also clone this into your editor to have it locally in your terminal and work with it yourself on your CLI.

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Credits

Content
The text for section project was taken from the brochure of Code Institutes brochure as it gives the idea which projects and what langauges I will be using in them.

Media
The photos used in this site were obtained from http://resizeimage.net/ and
https://stock.adobe.com/ee/. In the Windows10 picture editing application I modified the landing page picture, education section background and contact form background with the arctic filter. The picture for my landing page I found from google search word "taurus" from this webpage https://thetauruslife.com/badass-taurus-traits/.
For the icons I used the https://fontawesome.com source. The font was taken from https://fonts.google.com/.

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from the User centric design challenge Rosie's project. Specialy the contrasting sections and the invitation sentence to ask people to write about their projects to me. Also I wanted to have some features similar to the portfolio of Haley Schafer. For example the navbar and rounded icons.
